A collection of files and folders that are required to create and deploy an IOOS Documentation site with the [HUGO Static Web Page Generator](http://gohugo.io/) and Lanyon theme.

The skeleton file as and folders must be added to a `master` branch of a GitHub site, document files in markdown format with the appropriate front matters must be added to the `content` folder, and `config.toml` has to be modified as needed. The site structure and deployment procedure are described in the [Hosting on IOOS GitHub Pages Workflow](http://ioos.github.io/website_deployment_workflow_updated/).
